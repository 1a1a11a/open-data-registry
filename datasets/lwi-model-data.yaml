Description: >
  Geographic (land cover, land elevation, etc.), meteorologic (pluvial, wind, etc.), 
  hydrologic (fluvial, tidal, etc.), hydrodynamic (water surface elevations, flow velocities),
  and built environment (structures, levees, floodgates, culverts) data used as inputs to and 
  outputs from numerical modeling software in the prediction of flood risk in stochastic and
  probabilistic frameworks.This data was collected from open sources, such as from the 
  National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or the 
  United States Geological Survey (USGS), modified in format to suit the
  needs of the modeling program and software, and then used to predict flooding
  in Louisiana across a range of scenarios. The modeling software used to predict
  flooding which utilizes and creates this data is freely available from the 
  United States Army Corps of Engineers: The Hydrologic Engineering Centerâ€™s
  Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and River Analysis System (HEC-RAS).
  All data is made public by the state of Louisiana for the benefit of its citizens.
  This flood prediction data will be able to be used by federal, state, and local
  decision makers as well as private citizens to assess the flood risk they face and
  make sound science-based decisions for response and adaptation.
