Name: NREL ComStock Model
Description: |
  ComStock is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) model of the U.S. commercial
  building stock, developed and maintained by NREL. The model takes some
  building characteristics from DOE's Commercial Prototype Building Models and
  Commercial Reference Building. However, unlike many other building stock
  models, ComStock also combines these with a variety of additional public-
  and private-sector data sets. Collectively, this information provides
  high-fidelity building stock representation with a realistic diversity of
  building characteristics.
