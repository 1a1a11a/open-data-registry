Name: U.S. Building Stock
Description: |
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock, 
that culminated in this publicly available dataset of calibrated and validated 15-minute resolution load profiles 
for all major residential and commercial building types and end uses, across all climate regions in the United States. 
These EULPs were created by calibrating the ResStock and ComStock physics-based building stock models using many 
different measured datasets, as described [here](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/80889.pdf)
