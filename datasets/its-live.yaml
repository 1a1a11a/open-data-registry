Name: Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS-LIVE)
Description: >
  The Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS-LIVE) project has a singular mission: to
  accelerate ice sheet and glacier research by producing globally comprehensive, high resolution, low latency,
  temporally dense, multi-sensor records of land ice and ice shelf change, while minimizing barriers between the data
  and the user.

  ITS-LIVE data currently consists of NetCDF Level 2 scene-pair ice flow products posted to a standard 120 m grid
  derived from Landsat 4/5/7/8/9 and Sentinel-2 optical scenes, and Sentinel-1 SAR scenes. We have processed all
  land-ice intersecting image pairs from Mission start to the of 2022 for all missions, with a temporal baseline of
  500 days for optical pairs and 60 days for SAR paris. Over the next two years, we expect to continue processing new
  optical scene-pairs as they come in, extend the SAR temporal baseline and continue processing new Seninel-1 scenes
  as they come in. We also expect to extend processing to include ASTER, RADARSAT, and NISAR imagery. Further, all scene
  pair data is combined into a set of Zarr datacubes cloud-optimized for time-series analysis, with a suite of user
  tools available to effectively query the data.

  The ITS_LIVE project is also producing a suite of Level 3 products, including: quarterly and annual ice-sheet and
  regional velocity mosaics as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, standardized records of elevation change rates for Greenland
  and Antarctica, and ice shelf and tidewater glacier front positions.
