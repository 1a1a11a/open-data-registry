Name: Analysis Ready Sentinel-1 Backscatter Imagery
Description: |
  The [Sentinel-1 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) is a constellation of
  C-band Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) satellites from the European Space Agency launched since 2014.
  These satellites collect observations of radar backscatter intensity day or night, regardless of the
  weather conditions, making them enormously valuable for environmental monitoring.
  These radar data have been processed from original Ground Range Detected (GRD) scenes into a Radiometrically
  Terrain Corrected, tiled product suitable for analysis. This product is available over the Contiguous United States (CONUS)
  since 2017 when Sentinel-1 data became globally available.

UpdateFrequency: Data updates are paused while we repair the processing pipeline, but the target is to update on a daily cadence for the dataset's spatial domain (CONUS).
