Name: Earth on AWS - Sentinel-1 SLC dataset in unzipped form
Description: |
  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active remote sensing technique, where electromagnetic pulses are emitted and received by an antenna. The Sentinel-1 satellite mission consists of two identical satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 03 April 2014 and 25 April 2016 respectively (ESA, 2021a). These satellites orbit the Earth white acquiring SAR images at a wave frequency of 5.405GHz (C-band). This mission exploits the usage of 2 satellites in order to have a fast revisit time (12 days and down to 6 days in some areas).The main applications of the Sentinel-1 SAR images are the monitoring of land use changes and surface deformation along with support for emergency management. Further applications include but are not limited to monitoring of sea ice, icebergs, land ice, inland waters, oil spills, ships, and others (ESA, 2021a).
  The [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) SLC IW image collection provided by ESA are available in an archive format, that must be entirely downloaded in order to be used.
  This dataset represents the Sentinel-1 SLC IW data, from beginning to the present, in an unzipped form, allowing selective access to parts of the data that is needed for a given study area.
  Currently the dataset only covers Germany. Our next update will cover the entire Euope, after which we aim to cover the whole world.

UpdateFrequency: New Sentinel1-SLC IW data are updated regularly in an interval of 6 days, after they are available on the Alaska Satellite Facility endpoint.
