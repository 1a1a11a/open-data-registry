Name: GEOGLOWS Hydrologic Model Version 2
Description: |
  The GEOGLOWS Hydrologic Model provides a global simulation of river discharge. The model simulates river discharge at 
  7 million river segments over a period of more than 80 years beginning on 1 January 1940. The retrospective simulation 
  is updated weekly to monthly keeping the lag time small, between 5 and 12 days. The model is also used to produce 
  daily 15 day forecasts from a 51 member meteorology ensemble at 3 hour time steps. The retrospective simulation is 
  based on the ERA5 reanalysis climate data and forecasts are derived from the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS).<br><br>
  The stream network is derived from the TDX-Hydro streams and basins data produced by the United State's National 
  Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The model simulations are computed daily at the ECMWF super computing facility in 
  Bologna, Italy.<br><br>
  The geoglows-v2 bucket contains: (1) model configuration files used to generate the simulations, (2) the GIS streams 
  datasets used by the model, (3) the GIS streams datasets optimized for visualizations used by Esri's Living Atlas 
  layer, (4) several supporting table of metadata including country names, river names, hydrologic properties used for
  modeling.<br><br>
  The geoglows-v2-retrospective bucket contains: (1) the model retrospective outputs in (1a) zarr format optimized for 
  time series queries of up to a few hundred rivers on demand as well as (1b) in netCDF format best for bulk downloading 
  the dataset, (2) estimated return period flows for all 7 million million rivers (2a) in zarr format optimized for 
  reading subsets of the dataset as well as (2b) in netCDF format best for bulk downloading. (3) The initialization files 
  produced at the end of each incremental simulation useful for restarting the model from a specific date.<br><br>
  The geoglows-v2-forecasts bucket contains: (1) daily 15 forecasts in zarr format optimized for time series queries of 
  all ensemble members in the prediction, (2) CSV formatted summary files optimized for producing time series animated 
  web maps for the entire global streams dataset.
