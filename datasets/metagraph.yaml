Name: MetaGraph Sequence Indexes
Description: |
  The MetaGraph Sequence Indexes dataset comprises full-text searchable index files for raw sequencing data hosted in major public repositories. These include the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) Sequence Read Archive (DRA).

  All index files can be used with the MetaGraph framework for sequence search. Indexes can be jointly used for aggregated search in the cloud or can be individually downloaded for offline search.
