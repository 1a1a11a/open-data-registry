  - Description: |
      This dataset contains, among others, the following data:
        * Illumina short-read whole-genome CRAMs or BAMs, aligned to hg38 with [bwa-mem](https://github.com/lh3/bwa). BAMs must also be indexed.
        * Indexed GVCFs produced by GATK HaplotypeCaller, or a jointly genotyped VCF.
        * Family structure definitions file in [PED format](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531972-PED-Pedigree-format).
        * Reference files from the human reference genome Hg38.
