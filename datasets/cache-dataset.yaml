Name: Software Cache Request Dataset on AWS
Description: This is a dataset that contains thousands of traces, where each trace stores the requests made to software caches in a time period.  The dataset contains block cache workloads, key-value cache workloads, and object cache workloads. The dataset can be used for cache research, storage performance evaluation, and workload modeling.
