Name: Sentinel-1 Precise Orbit Determination (POD) Products
Description: >
  The Setninel-1 Precise Orbit Determination (POD) products contain auxiliary data on satellite position/velocity for the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite constellation and are a necessary input for nearly all Sentinel-1 data processing workflows.
  Sentinel-1 is a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite constellation first launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2014 as part of the European Union's Copernicus Earth Observation programme.
  This dataset includes all POEORB files, and it also includes RESORB files from the last 90 days. The most recent orbit files are added to this dataset within 20 minutes of their publication to the [Copernicus Dataspace Ecosystem](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/ComplementaryData/Additional.html#sentinel-1-orbits).

  For more information on the orbit products, see the [Copernicus POD Specification](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/documents/d/sentinel/copernicus-pod-service-file-format-specification).

UpdateFrequency: >
  Updated as new data becomes available on the [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/ComplementaryData/Additional.html#sentinel-1-orbits). Typically AUX_POEORB files are published daily and AUX_RESORB files are published every other hour.
