Description: 'Enhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP)-Air Sea Flux
  sub-facility collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during
  scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. Data
  product is quality controlled observations. Research Vessel Real Time Air-Sea Fluxes,
  equips the Marine National Facility (MNF) (Research Vessels Southern Surveyor and
  Investigator), the Australian Antarctic Division (Research and Supply Vessels Aurora
  Australis and Nuyina), and Research Vessel Tangaroa with "climate quality" meteorological
  measurement systems, capable of providing high quality air-sea flux measurements
  and delivered to researchers on a near real-time basis. Obtaining the full set of
  air-sea fluxes essential for climate studies requires observations of: wind, air
  and sea temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, long- and short-wave radiation.
  The existing ship meteorological sensor sets are completed with IMOS instruments
  and a comprehensive annual calibration program implemented. Data streams are fed
  into existing ship data management systems, and broadcast via satellite back to
  Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at the Bureau of Meteorology.
  A daily file of 1-minute averages of the observations are generated shortly after
  0000UTC and provided to IMOS.'
