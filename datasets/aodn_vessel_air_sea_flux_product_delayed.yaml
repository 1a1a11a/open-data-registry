Description: 'Enhancement of Measurements on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP)-Air Sea Flux
  sub-facility collects underway meteorological and oceanographic observations during
  scientific and Antarctic resupply voyages in the oceans adjacent to Australia. Data
  product is quality controlled bulk air-sea fluxes and input observations. Research
  Vessel Real Time Air-Sea Fluxes, equips the Marine National Facility (MNF) (Research
  Vessels Southern Surveyor and Investigator), the Australian Antarctic Division (Research
  and Supply Vessels Aurora Australis and Nuyina), and Research Vessel Tangaroa with
  "climate quality" meteorological measurement systems, capable of providing high
  quality air-sea flux measurements and delivered to researchers on a near real-time
  basis. Obtaining the full set of air-sea fluxes essential for climate studies requires
  observations of: wind, air and sea temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation,
  long- and short-wave radiation. The existing ship meteorological sensor sets are
  completed with IMOS instruments and a comprehensive annual calibration program implemented.
  Data streams are fed into existing ship data management systems, and broadcast via
  satellite back to Australia routinely. The observations are quality controlled at
  the Bureau of Meteorology and air-sea fluxes calculated using the COARE Bulk Flux
  algorithm. A daily file of calculated bulk fluxes and the observations used in the
  calculation are generated shortly after 0000UTC and provided to IMOS.'
