Name: Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Machine Learning Dataset
Description: We present a curated dataset from the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission in a format suitable for machine learning (ML) research. Beginning from level 1 scientific products, we have preprocessed this data by down-sampling AIA and HMI images from 4096 × 4096 to 512 × 512 pixels, removed QUALITY ne 0 observations, corrected for instrumental degradation over time, and applied exposure corrections. We also have ensured that both AIA and HMI data are spatially colocated, have identical angular resolutions, and that all instruments are chronosynchronous. The v1 version of the dataset is available in both .npz and .mm format and the v2 version is based on the v1 version, but converted to a cloud friendly Zarr format with full FITS header/keyword information. In addition, the degradation correction has been updated using latest calibration (v9). We anticipate this curated dataset will facilitate machine learning research in heliophysics and the physical sciences generally, increasing the scientific return of the SDO mission. This work is a deliverable of the 2018 NASA Frontier Development Lab program and also supported by SpaceML.org. Data from 2010-2018 are available for SDOMLv1 and data from 2010-2020 are available for SDOMLv2.
