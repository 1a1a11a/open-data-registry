Name: SPARTAN Data
Description: SPARTAN (Surface PARTiculate mAtter Network) measures and provides surface ambient particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentration and the chemical composition around the world, with the purpose of connecting ground-based PM2.5 and satellite remote sensing.
Documentation: https://spartan-cloud.readthedocs.io
