Description: "The Northwest Shelf (NWA) HF ocean radar system covers an area which\
  \ includes the Ningaloo Peninsula and the Ningaloo Reef to the west.  The Ningaloo\
  \ Reef is one of the longest and most pristine reefs in the world. The reef is rich\
  \ in marine biodiversity, with shark whales, turtles and fish aggregations, and\
  \ high primary and secondary productions which are controlled by the physical oceanographic\
  \ processes.  \n\nThe NWA HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element\
  \ receive arrays located at the Jurabi Turtle Centre (21.8068 S, 114.1015 E) and\
  \ Point Billie (22.5432 S, 113.690 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.2625\
  \ MHz, with a bandwidth of 25 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km.  Within the HF\
  \ radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data are also collected from\
  \ which wind directions and significant wave height can be calculated."
