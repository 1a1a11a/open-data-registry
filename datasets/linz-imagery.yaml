Name: New Zealand Imagery
Description: |
  The New Zealand Imagery dataset consists of New Zealand's publicly owned aerial and satellite imagery, which is freely available to use under an open licence.

  The dataset ranges from the latest high-resolution aerial imagery down to 5cm in some urban areas to lower resolution satellite imagery that provides full coverage of mainland New Zealand, Chathams and other offshore islands. 

  It also includes historical imagery that has been scanned from film, orthorectified (removing distortions) and georeferenced (correctly positioned) to create a unique and crucial record of changes to the New Zealand landscape.
