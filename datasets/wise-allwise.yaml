Name: AllWISE Data Release of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
Description: |
  The AllWISE program builds upon the work of the successful Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) by combining data from the WISE cryogenic and NEOWISE (Mainzer et al. 2011 ApJ, 731, 53) post-cryogenic survey phases to form the most comprehensive view of the full mid-infrared sky at its release in November 2013.

  AllWISE makes use of data from WISE, which is a joint project of the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, and NEOWISE, which is a project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology. WISE and NEOWISE are funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

  - Description: |
      The AllWISE Images Atlas is comprised of 18,240 4-band (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 micron) calibrated 1.56 deg x1.56 deg FITS images, depth-of-coverage and noise maps, and image metadata produced by coadding nearly 7.9 million Single-exposure images from all survey phases.

      The AllWISE Source Catalog contains accurate positions, apparent motion measurements, four-band fluxes and flux variability statistics for over 747 million objects detected on the deep, coadded Atlas Images. It is available in Apache Parquet, partitioned by HEALPix order 5. Additional presentations of this data may be added when available.
