Name: Slacken index collection
Description: Compiled genomic indexes for use with Slacken (taxonomic annotation of metagenomic sequencing reads)
Documentation: https://github.com/JNP-Solutions/Slacken
Contact: johan@jnpsolutions.io
ManagedBy: Johan Nyström-Persson
UpdateFrequency: These indexes are currently what was used in our 2025 publication introducing the concept of 2-step classification and comparing Kraken2 with Slacken. We intend to add a whole collection of large genomic indexes in the future.

    Notes: The NCBI Reference Sequence genome library with only complete genome sequences/chromosomes for those taxa that have them, and draft genomes/scaffolds otherwise, as well as adapter sequences (UniVec core).
  - Description: Slacken index built using the same genome set as the Kraken2 Standard database (https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2), ensuring compatibility and direct performance comparison.
